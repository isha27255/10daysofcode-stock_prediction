# Stock Prediction

"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" is what Arthur Samuel described Machine Learning.

**Machine Learning** or rather **ML** has found its applications in various fields in the past few years, some of which include Virtual Personal Assistants, Online Customer Support, Product Recommendations etc.


## So What exactly are we going to make?
In these 10 days of Code we will be using ML, taming the Stock market.
We'll create an application which will predict Stock Prices of a company using **LTSM**(Long Term Short Memory Model). (Rishav thora aur explain kar dena yeh wala part)

We will use libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` and a few others. You may have heard about these libraries or you may be encountering their names for the first time and it may seem like jargon but don't worry, we will walkthrough all of them and make you familiar with them

Let's start with <code>NumPy</code>, Shall we? 
**NumPy**, which for Numerical Python is an Open Source python library used for working with arrays. It consists of multidimensional array objects and also has functions for working in domain of Linear Algebra, fourier transform and matrices. 

So Why use NumPy?

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster that traditional Python lists.

The NumPy module does not come pre-installed with the python distribution and we have to install it seperately. It is often used with libraries such as scipy and matplotlib. We will see the installation later.
